# Cactus Game  
Made for the Low Effort Game Jam 6: [https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-6](https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-6)  
  
## Controls  
A-D, Space  
  
Move Left: A

Jump: Space  
  
## Other info  
Tested and works on Chrome for Windows. Not tested anywhere else. Not mobile compatible  
  
Built using my own game engine for HTML5/Canvas  
  
## It's not polished  
I am aware. This is infact the point of the jam. It is a low effort game, and while suping up the engine was rather high-effort, once completed I left my single braincell in my pocket to finish the game.  
  
## Is there an itch.io link?  
Maybe. I don't have one right now because I haven't submitted as I type this. If I can be bothered, it'll be here: \[not here yet\]  
  
## Licence?  
Special thanks to all people who made assets that I borrowed and then modified to make this game. Almost all of these are modified. Feel free to re-use these modified versions if you wish.
