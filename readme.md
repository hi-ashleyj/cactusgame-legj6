# Cactus Game  
Made for the Low Effort Game Jam 6: [https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-6](https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-6)  
  
## Controls  
A-D, Space  
  
Move Left: A  
Move Right: D  
Jump: Space  
  
## Other info  
Tested and works on Chrome for Windows. Not tested anywhere else. Not mobile compatible  
  
Built using my own game engine for HTML5/Canvas  
  
## It's not polished  
I am aware. This is infact the point of the jam. It is a low effort game, and while suping up the engine was rather high-effort, once completed I left my single braincell in my pocket to finish the game.  

## Maintainence?  
Nope! That's it. I'm going to be archiving and leaving this game alone forever. That's why it's got "archive" at the top.
  
## Is there an itch.io link?  
[It only took like a year, but there is now](https://hi-ashleyj.itch.io/legj6-cactusgame)
  
## Licence?  
Special thanks to all people who made assets that I borrowed and then modified to make this game. Almost all of these are modified. Feel free to re-use these modified versions if you wish.  
  
You are NOT permitted to use the game engine it is built in (game.js) and external components (levelmap.js) without express permission from the developer (me), outside of the context of this game. Modifications to this game are permitted given they are forks on github, and free to play. Copying the engine and/or components to create a new, unrelated game is not permitted.
